Toronto based millionaire with a penchant for building theatres. 

Mysteriously went missing in December 1919 after selling his theatre holdings for 1.7 million. 

Did his wife do it? Or his girlfriend? Or his business partner? 

Not sure, but his mansion is still at 51 glen road. 

His theatres have mostly been bulldozed for skyscrapers.
