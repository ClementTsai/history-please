#AvrilLavigne

Avril Ramona Lavigne is a Canadian pop-superstar who is thirty-five years old. She first broke out on the scene with hit singles like "Girlfriend" , "Complicated"
and "Sk8er boi". Twitter lore has it that the OG Canadian queen Avril died in 2003, and was replaced by a look-alike named "Melissa." 
This theory is in the realm of wild internet conspiracy theories which has attained an ironic meme status.
