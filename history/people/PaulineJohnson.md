# Pauline Johnson

Emily Pauline Johnson is an Indigenous poet. She was born in 1861 on the Six Nations Reserve, Canada West. Her father was a Mohawk Chief, while her mother was born in England. 
Some of Johnson's more well known poems are "The Song My Paddle Sings," and "A Cry from an Indian Wife". At the beginning of her writing career, 
she would not simply read her poems in front of audiences (as many other poets of her time did), but recited them to her audience.
