 The Halifax Explosion of 1917 was massive explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia caused by the collison of the *SS Imo* and *SS Mont-Blanc* on December 6, 1917. The *SS Mont-Blanc* was a cargo vessel filled with explosives, and thus the resulting collision created a massive explosion. Over 2000 were killed, and the event was considered the greatest man-made explosion of its time until the dropping of the atomic bombs Little Boy and Fat Man at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
