# Winnipeg General Strike of 1919

The Winnipeg general strike was a general strike in Winnipeg, Manitoba that brought nearly all economic activity in the city to a standstill. The strike lasted six weeks, and involved most of the cities 30,000 public and priviate sector workers, incuding all of the cities major unions as well as non-unionized workers and veterans groups. The cities workers hoped that they would be able to improve their conditions as they faced low wages and rising prices and rents. There is some debate about what caused the strike in Winnipeg specfically, as similar conditions existed throughout Canada after WW1. 

The strike was opposed by a group of businessmen calling themselved the Citizens Committee, as well as the Municipal Government. When the local police force refused to sign a pledge that they would not strike in sympathy they were nearly all dismissed, and replaced by largely untrained 'special constables'. Negotiations fully broke down after several of the most prominent leaders of the strike were arrested and charged with seditious conspiracy. The strike was ultimately broken through the liberal application of police brutality. On Bloody ~~Sunday~~ Saturday protests agianst the arrest of the strike leaders were disperesed by the RCMP who fired 120 rounds into the crowd, killing 2 and injuring 30.
