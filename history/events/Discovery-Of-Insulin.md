> Dr. Frederick Banting

For years, scientists tried to find a method to treat diabetes mellitus (more commonly just called diabetes) and make it possible to live with the disease.
Various experiments failed, and it was only in the summer of 1921 when a team from University of Toronto, led by Dr. Frederick Banting, discovered insulin in the pancreas. 
Of course, Dr. Frederick Banting and his supervisor, Dr. J.J.R. Macleod, received a Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for their great contribution.

### Fun Facts
- Dr. Banting had **__zero__ experimental research experience** prior to this project.
- Dr. Banting was knighted by King George V, and he was among the last cohort of Canadians appointed to the Order of the British Empire. 
- Connaught Laboratories purchased a farm with several stables in which Dr. Banting and his team could experiment on insulin production and isolation using horses.
- Many scholars and historians are questioning whether Dr. Macleod deserves the Noble Prize as many believe his research partner, Dr. Charles Best, contributed more. 
To learn more about Dr. Best, please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Best_(medical_scientist).
- Dr. Banting and his co-patent-holders sold the patent on their extraction of insulin for $1 to the University of Toronto in order to make it easier for insulin to be produced on a wider scale and thereby save more lives.
